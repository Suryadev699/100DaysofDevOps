## Day 23: Fork a Git Repository

The first step in contributing to an open-source project is to fork the repository. Forking creates a personal copy of the repository under your GitHub account, allowing you to make changes without affecting the original project.

1. Navigate to the GitHub page of the repository you want to contribute to.
2. Click the "Fork" button in the upper right corner of the page.
3. Select your GitHub account as the destination for the fork.
4. Once the forking process is complete, you will be redirected to your new forked repository.
5. Clone the forked repository to your local machine using the command:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/repository-name.git
   ```

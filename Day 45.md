## Day 45: Resolve Dockerfile Issues

The Nautilus DevOps team is working to create new images per requirements shared by the development team. One of the team members is working to create a Dockerfile on App Server 2 in Stratos DC. While working on it she ran into issues in which the docker build is failing and displaying errors. Look into the issue and fix it to build an image as per details mentioned below:
a. The Dockerfile is placed on App Server 2 under /opt/docker directory.
b. Fix the issues with this file and make sure it is able to build the image.
c. Do not change base image, any other valid configuration within Dockerfile, or any of the data been used â€” for example, index.html.

This is the pre written Dockerfile:

```Dockerfile
FROM httpd:2.4.43

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule\ ssl_module modules\/mod_ssl.so/s/^#//g' conf.d/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule\ socache_shmcb_module modules\/mod_socache_shmcb.so/s/^#//g' conf.d/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/Include\ conf\/extra\/httpd-ssl.conf/s/^#//g' conf.d/httpd.conf

COPY certs/server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt

COPY certs/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key

COPY html/index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
```

To resolve the issues in the Dockerfile and successfully build the Docker image, follow these steps:

Open the dockerfile located at /opt/docker on App Server 2.

The corrected Dockerfile should look like this:

```Dockerfile
FROM httpd:2.4.43

RUN sed -i "s/Listen 80/Listen 8080/g" /usr/local/apache2/conf/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule ssl_module modules\/mod_ssl.so/s/^#//g' conf/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/LoadModule socache_shmcb_module modules\/mod_socache_shmcb.so/s/^#//g' conf/httpd.conf

RUN sed -i '/Include conf\/extra\/httpd-ssl.conf/s/^#//g' conf/httpd.conf

COPY certs/server.crt /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.crt

COPY certs/server.key /usr/local/apache2/conf/server.key

COPY html/index.html /usr/local/apache2/htdocs/
```
Now the file issues are fixed and can proceed to build the Docker image.

## Day 31: Git Stash

Here we go again! Today, we're diving into the world of Git Stash. Imagine you're working on a feature, and suddenly, you need to switch branches to fix a bug. You don't want to commit your unfinished work, but you also don't want to lose it. This is where Git Stash comes in handy.

Navigate to the specific directory for today's exercise:

```bash
git status
```

```bash
git stash list
```

```bash
git stash pop stash@{0}
```

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Resolved merge conflicts and applied stashed changes"
```

```bash
git push origin master
```

This completes the git stash exercise for today.
